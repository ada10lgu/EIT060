ToDo:2 Project Instructions
2.1 Certificates, keystores and truststores
You first need to download and install OpenSSL and keytool. OpenSSL is included in most Linux
distributions. If you use Windows, you can find it at [3].
Read about certificates in the course book, and learn what keystores and truststores are (search
online). Then perform the following steps.
1. Create a X.509 CA certificate using OpenSSL. Set the commonName (CN) field of the certificate
to CA for clarity. Make sure to save the private key of the CA in a file. Question A: What does
the OpenSSL switch -CAcreateserial do?
2. Use keytool to create a truststore that contains the CA certificate (and nothing else). Name the
file clienttruststore (no file extension) and set the password to password.
3. Use keytool to create an end-user keypair that is stored in a (client-side) keystore. Use your full
names and STIL identities for the CN field for the certificate; X/X/X/X, where
X = <FULL NAME> (<STIL-id>)
for each respective group member. Name the file clientkeystore (no file extension) and set the
password to password.
4. Use keytool to create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) for the keys created in the previous step.
A CSR can be seen as a blueprint of a certificate that has not been signed yet.
5. Use OpenSSL to let your CA (from step 1) sign the CSR.
6. Import the certificate chain into your keystore. Note that you should import the CA certificate
before you import the signed certificate.
